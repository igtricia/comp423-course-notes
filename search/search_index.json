Project Set-Up: Creating Your Repository","text":"<p>(1) In your host machine's terminal, create a new directory for your project and cd into the directory. The directory is where you will directly interact with your project's files and reflects the local version of your project. <pre><code>mkdir go-project\ncd go-project\n</code></pre> (2) Initialize a new Git repository. This git subcommand creates a new empty repository:</p> <pre><code>git init\n</code></pre> <p>(3) Create a README file <pre><code>echo \"# go-project\" &gt; README.md\ngit add README.md\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit with README\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>(4) Navigate your GitHub account to the Create a New Repository page and fill in the details and repository name 'go-project'</p> <p>Link your local repository to Github using the code snippet below: <pre><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/go-project\n</code></pre> Note: Input your GitHub's username in the  text. <p>(5) Check your default branch name with the subcommand git branch. It is usually recommended to make your default branch main because later on in your project, merges and commits will be easier especially if you are collaborating with other teammates. If it's not main, rename it to main with the following command: <pre><code> git branch -M main\n</code></pre></p> <p>(6) Push local commits to Github repository using the code below: <pre><code>git push --set-upstream origin main\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/go-setup/#part-2-setting-up-the-development-environment-for-golang","title":"Part 2. Setting Up the Development Environment for Golang!","text":"<p>(1) Open your go-project directory in VSCode</p> <p>(2) Install the Dev Containers extension for VS Code if not installed already</p> <p>(3) Create a .devcontainer directory in the root of your project with the following :</p> <p><pre><code>.devcontainer/devcontainer.json\n</code></pre> (4) Update the devcontainer.json file with the following code snippet : <pre><code>{\n  \"name\": \"go-project\",\n  \"image\": \"mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/go:latest\",\n  \"customizations\": {\n    \"vscode\": {\n      \"settings\": {},\n      \"extensions\": [\n        \"golang.go\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Notes about the devcontainer.json file</p> <p><p> Name: A descriptive name for your dev container. </p> <p> Image: The Docker image to use, in this case, the latest version of a Go environment.

Build Your Hello World Project(- Possibly Your First Project with Golang! Hurray!)","text":"<p>Run the following commands in your terminal(inside the dev container)</p> <p>(1) Make a directory     <pre><code>mkdir HelloCOMP423\n</code></pre> (2) cd into the directory     <pre><code>cd HelloCOMP423\n</code></pre></p> <p>(3) When your code imports packages contained in other modules, you manage those dependencies through your code's own module. That module is defined by a go.mod file that tracks the modules that provide those packages. That go.mod file stays with your code, including in your source code repository. To enable dependency tracking for your code by creating a go.mod file, run the go mod init command, giving it the name of the module your code will be in.So, essentially we are creating a go module below: <pre><code>go mod init HelloCOMP423\n</code></pre> (4) In VSCode, create a file called main.go and save it. You can create a file using this line of code: <pre><code>touch main.go\n</code></pre></p> <p>Write the following code in your file.  <pre><code>package main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"Hello COMP423\");\n}\n</code></pre> (5) You can choose either of the following options for the next step/running your code</p> <ul> <li>Build and run manually using the go build subcommand: This is the equivalent to the gcc command used to compile a C program and generate an executable file. The go build subcommand essentially compiles your project and generates an executable file and is useful when you are only interested in building without immediately running, for example, during a deployment process.</li> </ul> <p><pre><code>go build main.go\n</code></pre> After running this command in your terminal, an executable 'main' file will be created. To run the executable main file, type in this code. <pre><code>./main\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Run directly using the go run command that compiles and runs the main.go file in a singular step.</li> </ul> <pre><code>go run main.go\n</code></pre> <p>What's the key difference</p> <p>The key difference between go run and go build is that go run compiles and immediately executes the code, while go build only compiles the code and creates an executable file in the current directory that you can run separately later as shown above.</p> <p>Alright- Congratulations! You have successfully setup your own Go development environment and written a program! Give yourself a pat on the back- and go out for a drink. </p>"}]}
